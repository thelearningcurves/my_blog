 This blog site has a definite purpose. I am a student of Geophysics and I wish to share my skills and understanding of the vastness
 of the subject with you guys. The topics I initially intend to address are Seismic Tomography, Inversion and it's types ,Deep Learning 
 and Machine Learning in Geophysics. Along with that I would be sharing my new found love for Data Science and statistics. Another topic that I would like to learn as I go on is Digital Signal Processing and Statistical signal processing.
